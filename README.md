# âœ¨ **EVOLVING ECOSYSTEM** âœ¨

## **Our scripts are growing into a distributed garden:**

### **ðŸŒŸ Premium Collection: [https://github.com/shibuido](https://github.com/shibuido)**

The **shibuido** organization hosts our most refined tools:
- **Individual repositories** for each KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid) script
- **Git superrepos** containing submodules for easy `git pull` and PATH management
- **Symbolic linking** into submodules for convenient access
- **Independent repos** for clean, focused development

### **ðŸ”§ This Repository's Role:**

`handy_scripts_misc` and `handy_scripts_CLIAI` remain the **experimental workshop** where:
- **New ideas** are prototyped and tested
- **Complex tools** that benefit from bundling live together
- **WIP scripts** evolve until they're ready for their own home
- **Specialized utilities** that don't fit the minimalist shibuido philosophy stay accessible

**Think of it as:** shibuido for the polished gems ðŸ’Ž, here for the creative chaos ðŸŽ¨

Handy scripts for daily workflows.


(We may add more links here as more tools get their own READMEs.)

In directory **sourceable** ðŸ“‚, one can source scripts or directories individually, or use `source path.../all.sh` (in your current shell or `.profile`/`.bashrc`) at any level to recursively source all scripts from that directory and its subdirectories.

If you really like script in root directory, you can even point your PATH in .bashrc to this directory ;).

Please check each script to know what is it about.
Maybe in future I will automate keeping readme updated about them.
## Tool-specific READMEs

Some tools/scripts have their own detailed README files in this directory. For example:

* [bookmarks_chromium.README.md](./bookmarks_chromium.README.md) â€” Documentation for `bookmarks_chromium.py`, a command-line and library utility for managing Chromium/Chrome/Brave bookmarks.
* [collect_urls_from_all_tabs.README.md](./collect_urls_from_all_tabs.README.md) â€” Documentation for `collect_urls_from_all_tabs.py`, a helper that collects URLs from all open browser tabs and copies them to clipboard.
* [git-branches-graph.README.md](./git-branches-graph.README.md) â€” Documentation for `git-branches-graph`, a tool that visualizes Git branch relationships as directed graphs in Mermaid, Graphviz, CSV, or PNG formats.
* [paste_lines_to_window.README.md](./paste_lines_to_window.README.md) â€” Documentation for `paste_lines_to_window.py`, a script that pastes lines into any focused window using xclip and xdotool.
