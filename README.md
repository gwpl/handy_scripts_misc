# `handy_scripts`

Handy scripts for daily workflows.


(We may add more links here as more tools get their own READMEs.)

In directory **sourceable** ðŸ“‚, one can source scripts or directories individually, or use `source path.../all.sh` (in your current shell or `.profile`/`.bashrc`) at any level to recursively source all scripts from that directory and its subdirectories.

If you really like script in root directory, you can even point your PATH in .bashrc to this directory ;).

Please check each script to know what is it about.
Maybe in future I will automate keeping readme updated about them.
## Tool-specific READMEs

Some tools/scripts have their own detailed README files in this directory. For example:

* [bookmarks_chromium.README.md](./bookmarks_chromium.README.md) â€” Documentation for `bookmarks_chromium.py`, a command-line and library utility for managing Chromium/Chrome/Brave bookmarks.
